# Park Ji-hoon Fan Website Blueprint

## **1. Overview**

This document outlines the plan for a fan website for the actor and singer Park Ji-hoon. The site will be a comprehensive resource for fans, featuring an introduction, filmography, a summary of his activities, and his upcoming schedule. The design has been updated to a whimsical and enchanting "Ghibli style" to create a warm and inviting experience for fans.

## **2. Design & Style (Ghibli Redesign)**

The design will be inspired by the heartfelt and nostalgic aesthetic of Studio Ghibli films.

*   **Bold Definition:** The UI will be soft, organic, and interactive, avoiding sharp edges in favor of rounded corners and natural-feeling elements.
*   **Fonts:** The typography will be changed to "M PLUS Rounded 1c" from Google Fonts to evoke a friendly, soft, and slightly whimsical feeling that matches the Ghibli aesthetic.
*   **Color Palette:** The palette will shift from a modern dark theme to a Ghibli-inspired one, featuring soft, natural colors like sky blue, gentle greens, and creamy whites, creating a light and airy atmosphere.
*   **Texture & Effects:** Drop shadows will be softened, and textures will be minimal to maintain a clean, illustrative feel. The main background will feature a beautiful, painterly landscape that evokes the scenery from a Ghibli film.
*   **Iconography & Interactivity:** Interactive elements will have gentle hover effects, like a subtle lift or a soft glow, to feel more organic and responsive.
*   **Accessibility:** The site will continue to adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring high contrast and readable fonts.

## **3. Features & Sections**

The website will be a single-page application with the following sections:

1.  **Header & Navigation:** A sticky header with a navigation bar to jump to different sections.
2.  **Introduction:** A hero section with a stunning Ghibli-style landscape and a welcome message.
3.  **Filmography:** A section showcasing his work, presented as interactive cards with a softer, more rounded design.
4.  **Activities:** A summary of his career as both an actor and a singer.
5.  **Schedule:** A section for his upcoming events and appearances.
6.  **Global Fan Community:** A warm and inviting section that links to his official global fan community. The previous "Today's Fortune" section will be repurposed for this. The link will direct to his official Daum Fan Cafe.
7.  **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright information.

## **4. Technical Implementation**

*   **Structure:** The site will continue to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Styling:** CSS will be updated to reflect the new Ghibli-inspired design, including new fonts, colors, and background images.
